# WASI HTTP

A proposed [WebAssembly System Interface](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) API.

### Portability Criteria

WASI-http must have at least two complete independent implementations
demonstrating embeddability in a production HTTP server context.

### Introduction

The WASI-http proposal defines a collection of [interfaces] for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses. WASI-http additionally defines a
[world], `wasi:http/proxy`, that circumscribes a minimal execution environment
for wasm HTTP [proxies].

[Interfaces]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md#wit-interfaces
[World]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md#wit-worlds
[Proxies]: https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#intermediaries

### Goals

The proposal intends to abstract over HTTP version and transport protocol
choices (such as HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3) by mapping directly to the
abstract [HTTP Semantics], allowing hosts to (mostly) transparently use any of
these.

The `wasi:http/proxy` world is meant to be implementable by a wide variety of
hosts including Web [service workers], forward- and reverse-[proxies] and
[origin servers] by requiring a minimal set of additional runtime support.

The `wasi:http/proxy` world is meant to support flexible auto-scaling
("serverless") execution by moving the core `accept()` loop into the host and
allowing the host to dynamically spin up wasm instances in response to arriving
requests.

The `wasi:http/proxy` world is meant to allow the chaining of HTTP
intermediaries to be implemented directly in terms of [Component Model] linking.
(Fully realizing this goal will require additional features only available in
the [Preview 3] timeframe.)

### Non-goals

WASI-http does not intend to define a more fully-featured cloud execution
environment (for this, see the [wasi-cloud-core] proposal).

### API walk-through

The proposal can be understood by first reading the comments of [`proxy.wit`],
then [`handler.wit`] and finally [`types.wit`].

[`proxy.wit`]: ./wit/proxy.wit
[`handler.wit`]: ./wit/handler.wit
[`types.wit`]: ./wit/types.wit

### Working with the WIT

Bindings can be generated from the `wit` directory via:
```
wit-bindgen c wit/ --world proxy
```
and can be validated and otherwise manipulated via:
```
wasm-tools component wit wit/ ...
```

The `wit/deps` directory contains a live snapshot of the contents of several
other WASI proposals upon which this proposal depends. It is automatically
updated by running [`wit-deps update`](https://crates.io/crates/wit-deps-cli)
in the root directory, which fetches the live contents of the `main` branch of
each proposal. As things stablize, `wit/deps.toml` will be updated to refer to
versioned releases.
